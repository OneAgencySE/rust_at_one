## About 💁💁‍♂️
This project is meant to be sort of a template to look at for future project.
It will contain everything you might need to start running an application in production.
Authentication, authorization, DB connections, containerization, Rest, Graphql etc

It does a lot but it might help to have an overview of an application that is actually in use somewhere and works.
Even though it might not be the best todo app you have ever seen.

### Setup 🛠🔋
Checkout `setup.sh`, it contains everything you need. 

To set it all up: `bash setup.sh`

To run using docker: `docker-compose -f stack.yml up`.
